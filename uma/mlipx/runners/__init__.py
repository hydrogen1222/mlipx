Calculation runners for different types of UMA calculations.

Each runner encapsulates the logic for a specific calculation type:
- SinglePointRunner: Single point energy/force calculations
- OptimizationRunner: Geometry optimization
- MDRunner: Molecular dynamics simulations
- BatchRunner: Batch processing of multiple structures
